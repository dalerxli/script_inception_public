To use these script in Blender:

-On Windows: Place them into the following directory:
C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts

-On GNU/Linux: Place them into the following directory:
~/.blender/scripts/
(I recommend creating a symlink to the scripts in the checked out repository instead. That way you can update it easily with "git pull". :) )
