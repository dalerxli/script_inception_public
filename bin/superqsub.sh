## To use this script, add the QSUBMAIL variable to your environment. You can add one of the following lines to your ~/.bashrc for example:
## single mail address:
#    export QSUBMAIL="foo.bar@bristol.ac.uk"
## multiple mail addresses:
#    export QSUBMAIL="foo.bar@bristol.ac.uk,big.boss@bristol.ac.uk"

# Additional env vars:
# PPN : processors per node
# TORQUE_QUEUE : default torque queue to use (ex: batch, bfdtd, etc)

# Check if all parameters are present
# If no, exit

# TODO: Intelligent qsub command alternative which also takes care of creating appropriate submission scripts, so we don't have to always generate them?...
# TODO: It would be nice if additional qsub options could be specified. Problem: Ho can a script/alias distinguish the script's path from the other options? (required for JOBDIR variable)
# TODO: -> solution: python argparse qsub.py (problem: no python3 on bluecrystal...)
