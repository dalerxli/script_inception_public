Hi,

Yes looked it out a couple of days ago.  Have tried building it and it works OK.  
Attached is the source code, where the daddy file is main.cpp. 
If you create a new project in Visual Studio and copy/import in all the files in the archive then 
it should build fine, providing you have unistd.h somewhere in the path, which you should have by default.

Let me know how you get on.

Cheers

Ian

It should all be on those externals I left on my machine.  Am on holiday for the next week, but will get the source code to that program asap (we are still living out of boxes at Jenna's parents and it is on an external hard drive).

I will dig out the code and send it on, I thought I had left it on optics on tea somewhere, but I might never have got round to it.  I can't exactly remember what the "res" option does - perhaps resolution, i.e. inverse mesh size?
